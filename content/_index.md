Hi, I am Gabriela! I am a master student of Neural & Behavioral Sciences at the University of TÃ¼bingen. I want to understand why people have irrational beliefs. To answer that, I am investigating mechanisms in decision-making, belief updating, and information seeking. I am currently working at Randolph Helfrich's lab.
