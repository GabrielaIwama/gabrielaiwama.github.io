Hi, I am Gabriela! I am a PhD student of Neural Information Procesing at the <a href='https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/'>University of TÃ¼bingen</a>.
As a long-term goal, I want to understand why people have irrational beliefs. 
To answer that, I am investigating the neural mechanisms underlying **prior integration**, **belief updating**, and **information-seeking**.
\I am currently working at <a href='https://helfrich-lab.com/'>Randolph Helfrich's lab</a> at the <a href='https://www.hih-tuebingen.de/en/'>Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research</a>.<br>
\Besides science, I love watercolor painting, digital illustration, and science fiction.
